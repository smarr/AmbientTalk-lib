In order to correctly initialize M2MI, do the following first:
1) copy the *.properties file in the conf directory to your home directory.
   (this allows both the M2MP Daemon (see below) and the M2MI API to
   access the properties)
2) in the device.properties file, change the ID to the MAC address
   of your network card (or a similar UNIQUE identifier)
3) If you want to use M2MI to contact objects running in other VMS
   (either local or remote), you need to set up the M2MP Daemon.
   In a separate console, run the 'runm2mpdaemon' script included
   in this directory.

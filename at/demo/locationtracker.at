/* A simple location tracker example.
 * Setting: a nomadic ad hoc network where some services are
 * Location Servers, while others are mobile Location Clients.
 * The clients continually submit their location to a location server.
 * The servers are considered to be linked up via the nomadic infrastructure.
 * This allows remote mobile clients in other parts of the network
 * to query the server for the position or track of another mobile client.
